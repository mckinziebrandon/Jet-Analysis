Description: Initial discussion of which project to choose.
==============================================================================

* Plot correlation function as deltaEta and deltaPhi.

* Did analysis in PbPb.
    --> Go large enough deltaEta, can study collective effects of flow. 
    --> Can study long range correlations.
    --> See double ridge in PbPb as sign of collectivity.

* Hydrodynamics wasn't supposed to work in small systems like p-Pb.
    --> Flow in p-Pb was unexpected. 
    --> Observe sign of correlations at large deltaEta. 

* CGC : Color Glass Condensate.
    --> Wiki:   is a type of matter theorized to exist in atomic nuclei 
                traveling near the speed of light. Observer sees a
                "gluonic wall" in length-contracted nucleus.
    --> Object: In p-Pb we don't see a v2, but we do see same mass 
                ordering of hadrons as in Pb-Pb. 

* Double ridge is excess of particles at high deltaEta. 

* Two-Particle correlations.
    --> Can study hydro/CGC.
    --> Study jet fragmentation. 

* Have observed deconfinement/hydrodynamics in pp (a little).

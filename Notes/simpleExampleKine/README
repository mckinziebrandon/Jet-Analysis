LOCAL GENERATION OF PYTHIA EVENTS IN ALIROOT 
ANALYSIS OF JET SPECTRA WITH FASTJET


./localKine.sh    This script  launches the local analysis
                  The analysis is done by embedding pythia events into empty ESD file  
                  (i do not know other way how to do that)  
                  at the moment you can specify in the configuration CMS energy of pp and  pT hat max and pT hat min
                  of pythia events. Pythia generator is by default 2.

listEmptyESD.list    this is a list of the empty esd files 

esdempty.root     empty esd file with 10000 events.  if you want to run more events just add copies of this 
                  file to the list listEmptyESD.list

clean.sh   simple script that i use to clean the directory after analysis

runEMCalJetAnalysis.C   macro that is called by ./localKine.sh, that sets up your task

AddTaskHJetSpectra.C            steering macro of your task, there you initiate object of your task

AliAnalysisTaskHJetSpectraM.cxx   your task object (there you do most of the changes see function FillHistograms)     
AliAnalysisTaskHJetSpectraM.h   



AnalysisResults.root  ...  output file with two TDirectories   one contains output histograms of your analysis
                         the latter one contans Xsection and nTrials
